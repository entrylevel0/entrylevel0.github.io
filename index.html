            <div id='block2' class="block"><p>Good Looking Records is a jungle and drum & bass record label, formed in 1991 by producer LTJ Bukem.
                The label specializes in jazz-influenced and atmospheric, so-called Intelligent Drum & Bass.
                The label releases music which includes 'spacey' synthesizers driven with elements of jazz and soul,
                although some releases have a darker amen break style to them. The label became synonymous for its musical style and science fiction-influenced record covers,
                which were a trademark of the label. Following the label's mid 2000s hiatus,
                all 12" singles issued were housed in a plain grey card sleeve with the label's logo on the front cover.</p></div>
